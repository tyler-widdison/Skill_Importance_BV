## Rally ending skill importance

This past week I have put fourth efforts into supervised machine learning. 

*"Supervised learning is where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output. The goal is to approximate the mapping function so well that when you have new input data (x) that you can predict the output variables (Y) for that data." * 

Here is what my (x) and (Y) considers:  

* I am looking at main draw matches won vs lost from 4 star, 5 star, WTF, and WCH. This is my (Y) or output variable.
* I am looking at these rally ending skills. This is my (x) or input variables:
  + Attack Kills
  + Attack Errors
  + Serve Ace
  + Serve Error
  + Block Stuff
  
 You can read more about supervised machine learning if your interested <https://machinelearningmastery.com/supervised-and-unsupervised-machine-learning-algorithms/>.

# Men's rally ending skill exploration

This data set includes 1,026 matches, played in main draw, from the 2019-2020 season (HAG 2019 - DOH 2020). Rally ending skills for 4 star, 5 star, World Championships and World Tour Final. 

```{r Mens skill importance EDA, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}

# Plot of importance  
*This in no way implies the variables that occur within these 5 rally ending skills.* For example maybe my team got stuffed blocked because I threw a terrible set to my partner or it is insanley windy one day and my partners set caused me to attack in the net. Maybe the serve ace was a trickler or 3 of the 7 attack kills I got were digs or passes over the net. Plus other variables. This becomes more of a starting point of what to look at next in depth.
